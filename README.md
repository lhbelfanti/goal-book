# GOAL (Book version)

The GOAL of this project is to continue learning Go by doing the exercises of the book ["The Go Programming Language"](http://www.gopl.io/) (by Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan).
[Book repository](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/).

The repository is divided in chapters. Each one of them contains the examples from the book and the resolution of the exercises proposed by the book.

### Chapter 1: Tutorial
It is a tutorial on the basic construct of Go, introduced through a dozen programs for everyday tasks like reading and writing files, formatting text, creating images, and communicating with Internet clients and servers.
