## Chapter 5 exercises

#### Exercise 5.1

Change the `findlinks` program to traverse the `n.FirstChild` linked list using recursive calls to `visit` instead of a loop.


#### Exercise 5.2

Write a function to populate a mapping from element names--`p, div, span, and so on`--to the number of elements with that name in an HTML document tree.


#### Exercise 5.3

Write a function to print the contents of all text nodes. in an HTML document tree.
Do not descend into `<script>` or `<stylr>` elements, since their contents are not visible in a web browser.


#### Exercise 5.4

Extend the `visit` function so that it extracts other kinds of links from the document, such as image, scripts, and style sheets.


#### Exercise 5.5

Implement `countWordAndImages`. (See Exercise 4.9 for word-splitting.)


#### Exercise 5.6

Modify the `corner` function in `gopl.io/ch3/surface` (ยง3.2) to use named results and a bare return statement.


#### Exercise 5.7

Develop `startElement` and `endElement` into a general HTML pretty-printer.
Print comment nodes, text nodes, and the attributes of each element (`<a href='...'>`).
Use short forms like `<img/>` instead of `<img></img>` when an element has no children.
Write a test to ensure that the output can be parsed successfully.
(See Chapter 11.)

#### Exercise 5.8

Modify `forEachNode` so that the `pre` and `post` functions
return a boolean result indicating whether to continue the traversal.
Use it to write a function `ElementByID` with the following signature
that finds the first HTML element with the specified `id` attribute.
The function should stop the traversal as soon as a match is found.

```golang
    func ElementByID(doc *html.Node, id string) *html.Node
```

#### Exercise 5.9

Write a function `expand(s string, f func(string) string) string` that replaces each substring `"$foo"` within `s` by the text returned by `f("foo")`.

#### Exercise 5.10

Rewrite `topoSort` to use `maps` instead of `slices` and eliminate the initial sort.
Verify that the results, though nondeterministic, are valid topological orderings.

#### Exercise 5.11

The instructor of the linear algebra course decides that calculus is now a prerequisite.
Extend the `topoSort` function to report cycles.

#### Exercise 5.12

The `startElement` and `endElement` function in `gopl.io/ch5/outline2` (ยง5.5) share a global variable, `depth`.
Turn them into anonymous functions that share a variable local to the `outline` function.

#### Exercise 5.13

Modify `crawl` to make local copies of the pages it finds, creating directories as necessary.
Don't make copies of pages that come from a different domain.
For example, if the original page comes from `golang.org`, save all files from there, but exclude ones from `vimeo.com`.

#### Exercise 5.14

Use the `breadthFirst` function to explore a different structure.
For example, you could use the course dependencies form the `topoSort` example (a directed graph),
the file system hierarchy on your computer (a tree),
or a list of bus or subway routes downloaded from your city government's web site (an undirected graph).

#### Exercise 5.15

Write variadic functions `max` and `min`, analogous to `sum`.
What should these functions do when called with no arguments?
Write variants that require at least one argument.

#### Exercise 5.16

Write a variadic version of `strings.Join`.

#### Exercise 5.17

Write a variadic function `ElementsByTagName` that,
given an HTML node tree and zero or more names,
returns all the elements that match one of those names.
Here are two example calls:

``` Go
    func ElementsByTagName(doc *html.Node, name ...string) []*html.Node
    images := ElementsByTagName(doc, "img")
    headings := ElementsByTagName(doc, "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4")
```

#### Exercise 5.18

Without changing its behavior, rewrite the `fetch` functin to use `defer` to close the writable file.

#### Exercise 5.19

Use `panic` and `recover` to write a function that contains no return statement yet returns a non-zero value.
