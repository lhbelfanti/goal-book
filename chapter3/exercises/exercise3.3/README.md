## Exercise 3 attempts

I've tried 4 different approaches for this exercise. The color of the polygons is determined by the depth on z of its corners. The idea of the exercise was to colour the peaks in red, and the valleys in blue.


Here are the results:

### First Approach

Seems to be the best of the four approaches.

### Second Approach

It could be a good approach too, but it doesn't distinguish between the low peaks and the valleys. The high peaks are represented well.

### Third Approach

Doesn't satisfy the exercise. The valleys are not blue, and the low peaks are colored in blue instead of an intermediate color between the blue and red. Switching the pinks areas by the blue areas would comply with the exercise.

### Fourth Approach

It does comply with the valley color requirement, it also complies the low peaks color requirement, but there is an error in the middle part of the high peak. Fixing that error would satisfy all the requirements.
