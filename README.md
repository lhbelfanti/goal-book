# GOAL (Book version)

The GOAL of this project is to continue learning Go by doing the exercises of the book ["The Go Programming Language"](http://www.gopl.io/) (by Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan).
[Book repository](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/).

The repository is divided in chapters. Each one of them contains the examples from the book and the resolution of the exercises proposed by the book.

The book's examples are numbered. Each one of the folder that contains the example starts with a number that specifies the order in which the example appeared in the book.


### Chapter 1: Tutorial
It is a tutorial on the basic construct of Go, introduced through a dozen programs for everyday tasks like reading and writing files, formatting text, creating images, and communicating with Internet clients and servers.

- [Examples](./chapter1/examples)
- [Exercises](./chapter1/exercises)

### Chapter 2: Program Structure
Describes the structural elements of a Go program: declarations, variables, new types, packages and files, and scope.

- [Examples](./chapter2/examples)
- [Exercises](./chapter2/exercises)

### Chapter 3: Basic Data Types
Discusses numbers, booleans, strings, and constants, and explains how to process Unicode.

- [Examples](./chapter3/examples)
- [Exercises](./chapter3/exercises)

### Chapter 4: Composite Types
Describes composite types, that is, types built up from simpler ones using arrays, maps, structs, and _slices_, Go's approach to dynamic lists.

- [Examples](./chapter4/examples)
- [Exercises](./chapter4/exercises)
